I’m a **Ph.D. candidate** in **Physics** at **Cornell University**, working with [Prof. Veit Elser](https://physics.cornell.edu/veit-elser). My research focuses on developing **constraint-based algorithms** and **optimization techniques** for challenging problems in **structural biology, applied mathematics, and robotics**.  

At the core of my work is an iterative projection method called **Reflect–Reflect–Relax (RRR)** — a chaotic search technique that finds the intersection of two constraint sets, even when the constraints are **non-convex**. To handle problems with many interacting constraints, we use the **divide-and-concur** formulation, where multiple replicas are created for each variable in the divide constraint set, and a concur constraint enforces their mutual consistency. This provides a **modular and interpretable framework** for representing and solving complex systems. This methodology has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems — from phase retrieval and packing puzzles to SUDOKU and even training neural networks without a loss function. For an accessible overview of these methods, see [Solving Problems with Projections](https://www.cambridge.org/in/universitypress/subjects/physics/mathematical-methods/solving-problems-projections-phase-retrieval-packing?format=HB&isbn=9781009475525) by Veit Elser.

During my PhD, I have worked on a range of problems including **Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)**, **Macromolecular Structure Refinement**, **Protein Folding**, and **Lattice Protein Models**, integrating concepts from mixed-integer programming, and constrained and nonlinear optimization to tackle complex, high-dimensional problems. For more details on these and other projects, visit the [Research](/research/) page.

Before starting my graduate studies at Cornell, I received my **Bachelors in Physics** from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

While AI and LLMs have transformed how we approach complex problems, they are not a universal solution. My research focuses on developing physically interpretable algorithms for domains where AI struggles -- approaches that uncover the underlying structure of complex systems and deepen our understanding rather than just producing outcomes. 

Outside of research, I tend to get deeply absorbed in whatever I’m trying to get better at -- lately that’s been badminton. Before that, it was chess, basketball, and frisbee. I also managed to crack the top 500 (out of nearly 3 million teams) in Formula 1 fantasy this season, which I'm quietly proud of.
